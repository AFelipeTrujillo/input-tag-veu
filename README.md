The inputTag Vue.js component allows users to add and manage tags. New tags can be entered via an input field; duplicates aren't added. Tags are displayed in a list with an "X" button for removal. If the input is empty and 'Backspace' is pressed, the last tag is removed. The design is sleek with subtle borders and an inline-flex layout.
